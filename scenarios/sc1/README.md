This scenario simulates the situation where there is a stronger traffic in the 
east<->west direction and lighter traffic in the north<->south direction. 
Specifically, there are 1,200 comming each hour through each road on E or W, 
and 600 cars coming on each road on N or S.

The cars decide on each junction whether to go straight (80%), turn left (10%),
 or turn right (10%).  

The grid was generated by the `generate_grid.py` file in the root directory. 

The scenario is created from the files in this directory. The flows are 
specified in the `grid.sc1.jtr.flows.xml` file. The JTR router is used to 
create the routes. The turn probabilities can be set in the 
`scenario1.jtrconfig.xml` as the `turn-defaults` parameter (the numbers are 
probabilities for right turn, straight, and left turn respectively).

In order to recreate the routes (possibly with a different seed) simply run

````bash
    jtrrouter -c scenario1.jtrconfig.xml 
````
